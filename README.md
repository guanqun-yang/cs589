# Overview

This repository is the companion to the course [CS-589: Text Mining and Information Retrieval](https://liususan091219.github.io/teaching/cs589_21f/cs589.html) at the Stevens Institute of Technology. It provides the data and Google Colab-based starter code for assignments.

The associated paper of the dataset could be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3283812.3283815) and the download link for the **entire** dataset could be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X5GoVi_OcRxahXH1pRW7TSesZUeMH3ss/view?usp=sharing). Note that in the assignments, we only use a **subset** of the dataset because of the [computation resource limits](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#resource-limits) set by Google.
